    <p>
	Our pets have become members of the family, working, playing, eating, and sleeping at our sides. To ensure that we live together harmoniously, training helps both human and canine family members learn each other’s needs and limits.
	We offer low-cost group dog training classes, with discounts for recent SPCA adopters. Below are the currently scheduled classes. Please click on the registration links below or call 777 - 888 - 9999 to reserve a spot in an upcoming class.
	About the Trainers: Our trainers believe strongly in strengthening the bond between human and companion animal. For this reason, they regard training as an exercise in building relationship rather than obedience. Such an 	approach promises greater understanding and symbiosis within our family packs. All SPCA trainers are certified by the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers.</p>
