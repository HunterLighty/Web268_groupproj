						<h5>Brushing</h5>
                    	<p class="card-text">Several brushing sessions a week will keep the average dog neat and clean; daily attention is even better. Brush all the way down to the skin, letting the massaging action stimulate blood circulation and loosen and remove flakes of dandruff. The kind of equipment you need depends on your dog’s coat texture and length. Longhaired dogs need pin brushes, which have long, round-ended stainless-steel or chrome-plated pins. Short-, medium-, and some long-coated breeds need bristle brushes. There are also slicker brushes for removing mats and dead hair; rubber curry combs to polish smooth coats and remove dead hair; clippers, stripping knives, rakes, hair dryers, and other grooming tools. When brushing, always check for burrs and other stubborn plant material; mats, which most frequently form behind the ears and under the legs; and any cuts or scrapes on the skin itself. All dogs shed, though some definitely shed more than others. Regular brushing will help keep shedding under control.</p>
						<h5>Bathing</h5>
						<p>Your dog should have regular, but not frequent, baths, depending on the breed and coat of your dog. Too-frequent washing removes natural oils and causes the coat to become dry and harsh. When necessary, use a mild shampoo formulated for dogs. Stand the dog in a tub or basin, and put cotton balls in his ears and a couple of drops of mineral oil in his eyes. Wet the dog with warm water and apply shampoo from the neck back. After lathering and scrubbing, rinse your dog thoroughly with warm water. Rub vigorously with a towel (he’ll help you with vigorous shaking!), and then blow-dry if necessary. Comb or brush as required.</p>
						<h5>Trimming</h5>
						<p>Nails must be kept short for the feet to remain healthy. Long nails interfere with the dog’s gait, making walking awkward or painful. They can also break easily. This usually happens at the base of the nail, where blood vessels and nerves are located, and precipitates a trip to the veterinarian. If you can hear the nails clicking on the floor, they’re too long. To trim your dog’s nails, use a specially designed clipper. Most have safety guards to prevent you from cutting the nails too short. You want to trim only the ends, before the “quick” which is a blood vessel inside the nail. (You can see where the quick ends on a white nail, but not on a dark nail.) Clip only the hook-like part of the nail that turns down. Many dogs dislike having their nails trimmed. You can make it a painless procedure by getting your dog used to having his feet handled in puppyhood. Start trimming gently, a nail or two at a time, and your dog will learn that you’re not going to hurt him. If you accidentally cut the quick, stop the bleeding with some styptic powder. If you find it impossible to clip your dog’s nails, take him to a veterinarian or groomer.</p>

						<h5>Brushing</h5>
                    	<p class="card-text">Brushing your cat not only removes dirt, grease and dead hair from her coat, but it helps to remove skin flakes and stimulates blood circulation, improving the overall condition of her skin. One or two brushings per week will help kitty to keep her healthy glow—and you’ll find that regular sessions are especially beneficial when your cat ages and is no longer able to groom so meticulously on her own.hed, though some definitely shed more than others. Regular brushing will help keep shedding under control.</p>
						<h5>Bathing</h5>
						<p>With her built-in grooming tools (tongue and teeth), your fastidious feline is well-equipped to tackle her own hair care needs. But if she is very dirty or gets into something sticky or smelly, you may need to give her a bath. Make sure her claws are trimmed before bathing for your own safety, gently place some cotton in the ears to keep water out, and be sure to thoroughly dry after the bath is complete.</p>
						<h5>Trimming</h5>
						<p>Create a quiet, peaceful environment for her to relax, it's important that the cat feel soothed before attempting to cut her nails. You can further improve this by making sounds with the clippers before trimming aswell. Do not forget to regularly and gently massage your cat's paws, as to help her get used to you handling her feet. Be sure to only trim the <strong>white</strong> parts of the nail, as the <strong>pink</strong> areas contain the majority of the nerve endings, and are incredibly sensitive to the touch; aswell as being prone to bleeding. </p>

						<h5>Grooming</h5>
                    	<p class="card-text">Grooming is a fantastic way to bond with your horse, as well as keep them healthy, and provide you opportunities to see health problems earlier than you otherwise would have, but where do you start?For starters, you should only be grooming your horse around once a week, or depending on how dirty they get by themselves, before every ride. Make sure to look into a grooming kit, consisting of: Curry comb, Stiff brush, Soft brush, Metal curry comb, Mane brush (or comb), Sponge, Stable rubber, Hoof pick, and Marlinspike. Not all these are completely necessary, but will greatly aid you in efficiently and effectively cleaning your magnificent friend!</p>
						<h5>Bathing</h5>
						<p>A small, soft sponge should be used to clean the face, especially around the eyes, nose, ears, and lips. A separate small sponge should be used to wipe down the dock and groin. The body and legs can be tackled with a larger sponge.
						<h5>Hooves</h5>
						<p>Use the hoof pick to clear out dirt, matted hay or straw, manure, and any other debris. Work from heel to toe, paying careful attention to the cleft around the frog. A stiff brush, which some hoof picks have attached, is nice for brushing away the bits of dirt and chaff. You might like an illuminated hoof pick for getting a good look at the nooks and crannies that are hard to see if the light isn’t good. Clean off the sole, and pick gently around the area of the hoof just to the inside of the hoof wall. This is the white line, and you don’t want to jab into this area, as it’s a bit softer than the rest of the hoof. But this can be an entry point for things like grit and small stones, which can lead to seedy toe or white line disease. The frog also is softer and more sensitive, so be careful not to pick too aggressively in this area.</p>
